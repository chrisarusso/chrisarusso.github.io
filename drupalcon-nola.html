                        BTW: if you get a chance to read Kanye's twitter feed, DO IT. At least make you feel better.

                        Second by the way, I have to apologize for poking fun and pretending. There are no actual rumors
                        about Jamroom CMS and his involvement in jam but if that's the kind of fake news you're interested in hearing

                    Drupal MAY not be a good solution if you’re
                    Inertia!
                    What’s the current site in?
                    What are devs used to?
                    What are admins used to?
                    Client is not expecting support / new updates
                    Shoe-horn into Drupal is damaging to the experience broadly.

                    Client that isn’t ready for maintenance upgrades
                    Answer - Jekyll github hosted
                    Client that expects their team to be able to develop against it, but has no Drupal experience
                    That’s why there are so many rescue projects out there. Might be good for your team for a bit, but bad for product in general.
                    Client that doesn’t need to update things over time, isn’t interested in the latest and greatest tech.
                    Client who is familiar and likes another CMS. Sometimes this is okay, but dragging them away and changing things up, you better have a real benefit to it vs. you’re familiar with developing in it.
                    Client who have developers who are .net or the like
